OK, we are getting closer.

So, on the 2560 - the Mega, You can't use pins 4 and 5 for software serial. Change those two pins to 10 and 11.

So, UNO pin 4 to Mega pin 11 / UNO pin 5 to Mega pin 10 / UNO GND to MEGA GND

Then in the program on the Mega only change the statement:

SoftwareSerial SSerial(4,5); // RX, TX

to:

SoftwareSerial SSerial(10,11); // RX, TX

The syntax is SoftwareSerial mySerial(10, 11); // RX, TX note the RX first and the TX second.

Mark uses constants for the pins and they are set at the beginning of the code
const byte HC12RxdPin = 4; // "RXD" Pin on HC12
const byte HC12TxdPin = 5; // "TXD" Pin on HC12
const byte HC12SetPin = 6; // "SET" Pin on HC12



running so that is one less variable. If you do procced with my suggestions don't forget that you have to connect TX to TX and RX to RX I know this does not sound logical but these signals are from the ATMEGA16. So the TX on that would got to the RX terminal on the ATMEG328P which is why it is marked RX.
